Maid of the household. She took care

that lived there. She was paid quite
well because the owner was rich. She
also lives with the family that she 
takes care of and stays in her own 
room inside the house. She was found 
wandering on the staircase. She claims 
to know nothing about the murder, yet 
she also claims to have been there all day. 
She was too frightened to answer many 
questions, but you decided to keep her 
in mind anyway.
