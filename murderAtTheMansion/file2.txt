Realtion to the dead:
Randalph is the neighboor of
the dead, and has been for the past 
twenty five years since they first
moved there with the kid. He and 
Marvin(dead) have been friends ever 
since he moved in. They tend to
go play a lot of golf together

and watching a golf game. He claims that
he was on the couch practically the whole
night when the party was happening.
