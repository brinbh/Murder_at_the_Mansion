Footprint Clue --------------

This clue was found in the location
1,4 in the master bedroom just a few 
steps away from the body. What you see
it seems to be quite a large footprint
around the size of 13. Which can only
be one of the males footprints in 
the house. We need to find further clues
to find out who the murderer is.
