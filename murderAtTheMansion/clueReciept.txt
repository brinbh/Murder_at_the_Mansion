Reciept Clue -------------

The location of this clue was found
in 1,0. Right on top of the table 
located right near the front door near
his keys. The receipt says that he was
out to eat at lunch at a really fancy
resturant in town. But looking at the 
bill you can see that he was not alone.
Not even at a fancy resturant could
you spend $60 on lunch by yourself. 
It also said that they bought some 
drinks as well as their food.
I wonder who he was with?
