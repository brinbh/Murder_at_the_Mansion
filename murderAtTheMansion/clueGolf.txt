Golf Club Clue -------------

This clue was found in the location 1,2.
It was also found a room a way from the
body of Marvin, we believe that this is
the murder weapon from the amount of blood
on it, and how it has be slightly damaged.
It looks as if the person welding this 
weapon tried to hit Marvin but missed a 
few times. The head of the golf club is
quite large so it makes sence why this 
is considered the murder weapon.
